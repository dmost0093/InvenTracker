# Retrospective

Throughout the project timeline, our group demonstrated excellent communication and consistently met the deadlines set during our project planning stages. This cohesion allowed us to progress smoothly and maintain a clear understanding of each team member's responsibilities and progress.

However, we did encounter some challenges during the development process, which provided valuable learning experiences for the team:

## **Inexperience with Databases:**

Developing an inventory management system required us to work extensively with databases to efficiently store and retrieve inventory data. Some team members had limited experience with database usage, leading to initial difficulties in designing the database schema and implementing proper data handling. However, we proactively addressed this challenge by conducting research, seeking external resources, and collaborating with more experienced team members to improve our database implementation gradually.

## **Challenges with Android Development Tools and GUI Development:**

As our inventory management system targeted the Android platform, some team members faced challenges with Android development tools and graphical user interface (GUI) design. Understanding the intricacies of Android Studio, XML layout files, and ensuring a smooth user experience required time and effort. To overcome this hurdle, we organized internal workshops and shared online tutorials to enhance our knowledge and skills in Android development.

## **Ensuring Proper Testing for Each Feature:**

We recognized the importance of thorough testing for each feature after its development, but implementing an effective testing strategy posed its own set of challenges. Striking a balance between writing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, while maintaining code coverage, was initially challenging. As a solution, we integrated test-driven development practices into our workflow, which helped us identify and resolve issues early in the development process.

## **Understanding Exact Requirements for Proposed Features**

The inventory management system had multiple proposed features, and ensuring a clear understanding of the exact requirements for each feature was crucial. Miscommunication or vague specifications could lead to discrepancies between our implementation and the stakeholders' expectations. To address this, we conducted frequent meetings with group members, clarified requirements through documentation and mockups, and sought feedback at every milestone with each other to that each feature was on the right track for development.
